Dynamic Agent Creation - Runtime Actor Spawning and Parent-Child Communication
================================================================================

This example demonstrates dynamic agent creation at runtime:
- Custom message types (ProcessTaskRequest, TaskResult)
- Creating child agents at runtime via createActor() within an existing agent
- Replying via sender (always valid ActorAddress for Message subclasses)
- Context propagation from parent to child agents
- Tracking created workers in _children list
