"""Agent profile cards for team capability discovery.

AgentCards describe available agent profiles/roles in a team, enabling
dynamic discovery of capabilities and agent creation patterns.

IMPORTANT: Always use get_config() to obtain config for agent instantiation.
This ensures each agent gets an independent copy, preventing shared mutable state bugs."""

    AgentCards form a capability catalog, allowing agents to discover
    what profiles exist and how to work with them. This is not instance
    tracking—it's a profile directory.

    Example:
        >>> card = AgentCard(
        ...     role="ResearchAgent",
        ...     description="Performs web research and data gathering",

        ...     routes_to=["WriterAgent", "AnalystAgent"]
        ... )
        >>> # Now other agents can discover this profile and its config

        ['web_search', 'pdf_extraction']
        >>> card.can_route_to("WriterAgent")

    Attributes:

        skills: List of capabilities this agent provides
        agent_class: Fully qualified class name (str) or actual class (type) for instantiation
        config: Default BaseConfig (or subclass) for this profile
        routes_to: List of roles this agent can send requests to.
                   Empty list means can route to any role (no restrictions).
                   Agents can always respond to requests regardless of this field.
