    Agents maintain state that can change during message processing.
    BaseState provides:
    - Observer pattern for reactive workflows (state changes notify orchestrator)
    - Pydantic model for validation and serialization
    - serializable_copy() for safe persistence without observer references

    The observer is stored as a private attribute and excluded from
    serialization to prevent circular references.

    Attributes:
        _observer: Private observer reference (not serialized).

    Example:
        >>> class WorkerState(BaseState):
        ...     tasks_completed: int = 0
        ...     current_task: str | None = None
