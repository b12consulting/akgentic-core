"""ActorAddress abstraction for agent references and communication.

Provides an abstract interface for agent addressing that decouples agent identity
from the underlying actor implementation (Pykka). Supports serialization for
Phase 3 remote communication and rich metadata access.

Phase 3 Extensibility:
    This module defines the ActorAddress ABC that can be extended for remote
    communication. Future implementations may include:
    - ActorAddressRemote: HTTP-based remote actor communication
    - ActorAddressRedis: Redis pub/sub based communication

Example:
    >>> # Using ActorAddress in an Agent (future Agent class)
    >>> class Agent(pykka.ThreadingActor):
    ...     @property
    ...     def myAddress(self) -> ActorAddress:
    ...         return ActorAddressImpl(self.actor_ref)

    """Abstract base class for actor address/reference.

    Provides a unified interface for agent identification and communication

    references should use this abstraction rather than raw ActorRef.

    The address provides rich metadata (name, role, team_id, squad_id) without
    exposing internal implementation details. Implementations handle different
    scenarios: live local actors, deserialized proxy addresses, and stopped actors.
